# Solving Problems With Apps

## Why I Love Software Engineering

Software engineering is exciting because it’s all about solving problems. Every bug, every feature request, every half-formed idea is really just another puzzle waiting for a solution. For me, one of the most rewarding parts of programming is turning those ideas into something tangible—something that works, something that makes life easier. I especially enjoy building websites and apps because they sit right at the intersection of creativity and functionality. You can design something that looks sleek, but also solves a real problem.

## Turning Ideas Into Tools

Over the past few months, I’ve been thinking about the kinds of apps I wish existed—apps that would remove mental friction from my daily life. Here are three projects that excite me the most:

### A Bible Study App for Real-Life Questions

When life throws problems at me, I often turn to the Bible for wisdom. But finding the right verse can take time, especially if you don’t know where to look. I imagine an app where you type in a problem or a keyword—say, “anxiety” or “forgiveness”—and instantly get verses that address that exact issue. This wouldn’t just be a digital concordance; it would be an intelligent system that understands the nuance of human struggles and matches them with Scripture in a way that feels personal and timely.

### Smarter Warm-Up Planning at the Gym

Lifting weights is one of my hobbies, but figuring out the right warm-up sets can feel like guesswork. If I want to bench 225 pounds, how do I break that down into warm-up sets that prepare my muscles without tiring me out? An app could take my target working set and automatically generate three progressive warm-up sets. That way, I can just walk into the gym, follow the plan, and focus on the lift itself instead of the math.

### AI-Powered Meal Planning

Diet is just as important as training, but meal planning often feels like a chore. I want to build something that takes the food I already have, calculates my macros, and generates a meal plan for the day. The key is that it’s powered by AI but not just a chatbot. Instead, it would work like a silent assistant in the background: you input your pantry and your goals, and it outputs a clean, organized plan. No scrolling through endless meal-prep videos or spreadsheets—just a straightforward, data-driven answer.

## Why These Ideas Matter

What excites me about these projects is that they aren’t just “cool apps.” They’re problem-solvers. Each one tackles a specific pain point: searching for Scripture in meaningful ways, taking the guesswork out of workouts, and simplifying nutrition. They also highlight how software engineering can connect with every part of life—faith, fitness, and food.

## The Big Picture

These ideas are just starting points, but they illustrate something bigger: the beauty of software engineering is that you can take something as personal as your daily struggles and turn them into tools that help not only you, but potentially thousands of other people. That’s the heart of why I code. It’s not just about algorithms and syntax—it’s about building solutions that make life better.
