This project started from a simple but powerful question: *what if finding Scripture could be as quick as searching Google?* I wanted to create a Bible Study app that allows users to input a problem, struggle, or keyword—such as “anxiety” or “forgiveness”—and instantly receive relevant verses. Unlike a traditional concordance, the app is designed to understand nuance in phrasing and return meaningful, contextual matches.  

My role was to design the core search functionality and user interface. I experimented with natural language processing and indexing methods to handle flexible queries. I also designed a clean UI that encouraged focus on the Scripture itself, rather than distracting with clutter. This was my first attempt at combining faith-driven goals with real-world software engineering.  

From this project I learned how challenging it is to translate fuzzy human input into precise database queries. I also learned how to balance technical ambition with practical implementation: while AI can make search more “intelligent,” sometimes a well-structured dataset and careful UX is more valuable than overcomplicated models.
