Weightlifting is as much about preparation as performance. I noticed that many lifters—including myself—struggle to plan their warmup sets effectively. If my working set is 225 pounds, how should I structure the sets leading up to it? Should I jump straight from the bar to heavy weights, or gradually build up? My app solves this by generating three progressive warmup sets automatically once the user inputs their target weight.  

I built this project using TypeScript and emphasized precision in calculations. I developed algorithms that adjusted warmup increments depending on the target load, ensuring that the plan scaled logically for both beginner and advanced lifters. On the front end, I built a minimalist interface to keep the focus on usability.  

This project taught me how to translate real-world heuristics into software logic. It also improved my testing practices, since fitness apps must handle a wide range of edge cases—what if the working set is very light, or extremely heavy? Debugging those cases gave me valuable insight into algorithm validation and user experience design.
